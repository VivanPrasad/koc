# Kingdom of Cards
Kingdom of Cards is a strategy game. Each game is not like the last, with different circumstances. You may be of a higher class, homeless, or imprisoned in a dungeon. 
Fate is upon the cards in your hand. The heart of the town, market square: home to its lively economy and the erstwhile fountain. 
Within the square are stalls with food and items plenty to sustain life. There are thin rules: innovation is key in victory. 
The town is interconnected, so tread with caution. Your decisions impact the world. However, it is not always fair. One cannot follow the right path eternally.
